                        <br />
                        Irma Olguin Jr. oversees the screening and interviewing
                        of all employment candidates and apprentices for Bitwise
                        Industries, including that of Bitwise Workforce Training
                        and Bitwise Technology Services. Her goal is to ensure
                        Bitwise always remains faithful to its mission of
                        strengthening Fresno’s tech industry and turning it into
                        a driver of real economic progress.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The idea of Bitwise was hatched in 2012 over a Red Bull
                        (hers) and a gin and tonic (his) with her then IP
                        attorney, Jake Soberal. Fueled by a series of aha
                        moments, they decided they were in a unique position to
                        build such a mechanism for progress.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Previously, Irma created 59DaysOfCode, a competition
                        highlighting and encouraging the Valleyʼs tech industry.
                        She co-founded Hashtag, an open co-workspace for
                        designers and developers alike. She also co-founded Edit
                        LLC to solve efficiency and data issues in the ag
                        industry.

                        Vielka (Yudelka) Solano is a doctor, practicing
                        physician’s assistant, and poet. She was born on a balmy
                        February day in Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican
                        Republic. Vielka obtained her Doctor of Medicine degree
                        from the Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo, where
                        she also studied political science. While at university,
                        Vielka became passionate about social justice and
                        political activism; she began writing poetry, as well as
                        partaking in theater and community organizations that
                        sought change in her country. After immigrating to the
                        United States, and settling in Modesto, CA, Vielka
                        earned her Physician’s Assistant Certificate at UC Davis
                        and started working for Golden Valley Health Centers.
                        For over 20 years, she has been providing healthcare to
                        the underserved, mostly Spanish speaking, community at
                        their clinic in rural Patterson, CA.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In addition to her work at the clinic, Vielka is
                        committed to providing medical care to those in need
                        around the globe. As a missionary with various
                        organizations, she’s cared for patients in Indonesia,
                        Malawi, Thailand, Uganda and the Dominican Republic. In
                        2018, she began working directly with orphanages in
                        Uganda and made subsequently trips there. Though her
                        planned return to Africa in 2020 was impossible, due to
                        the pandemic, she was able to go there in 2021 even
                        during the pandemic and was able to work in a refugee
                        camp providing medical services to over 500 refugees.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Since the 1980s, Vielka has been sharing her poetry,
                        through public readings and four published books:
                        <span class="fst-italic">Experience and Solitude</span>,
                        <span class="fst-italic"
                          >A Woman of Flesh and Verse</span
                        >, <span class="fst-italic">From War to Love</span>, and
                        <span class="fst-italic">Naked Offering</span>. Her work
                        has garnered attention for its intensity and difficult
                        subject matter, such as social injustice, the trauma of
                        war, and domestic violence. Vielka’s writing has been
                        featured in newspapers and magazines both in the United
                        States and internationally. Excerpts of her work can be
                        found in:
                        <span class="fst-italic"

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Vielka has been invited to participate in literary
                        events across Latin America and the United States,
                        including 20th International Festival Mujeres Poetas en
                        La Ciudad de Las Nubes and IV Encuentro Internacional de
                        Mujeres Poetas en la Cuenca del Papaloapan, both in
                        Mexico, XXXIV Encuentro de Mujeres Poetas in Colombia,
                        Festival Internacional de Poesia in Cuba, and the 10th
                        Latino Writers’ Conference in New Mexico. Most recently,
                        she was honored to be one of 16 poets selected to pair
                        with a photographer to create
                        <span class="fst-italic"
                          >Collision VI: At the Intersection of Poetry &
                          Photography</span
                        >, in her adopted hometown of Modesto. Four years ago,
                        she started Noche de Poesia: a monthly, Spanish
                        language, poetry open mic night—the only event of its
                        kind in the region.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In 2019, Vielka was among the recipients of the
                        Outstanding Women of the Year award, given by the
                        Stanislaus County Commission for Women. She has also
                        received the Concilio Unsung Hero award and was given a
                        certificate for Distinguished Participation by Senator
                        Brian P. Stack, after she presented her book,
                        <span class="fst-italic">Experience and Solitude</span>,
                        at an art gallery in his state of New Jersey.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Recently, her two passions, medicine and poetry, have
                        come together in “Poesia y Arte Curando el Alma” under a
                        grant from Blue Shield of California. This pilot project
                        aims to reach those who have suffered domestic violence
                        in the Spanish community. In a culture that often does
                        not encourage trauma to be spoken, “Poesia y Arte
                        Curando el Alma” hopes to give victims of domestic
                        violence a voice through the arts, including poetry.

                        Though serious about her work, it isn’t all medicine and
                        poetry for Vielka Solano. She also enjoys traveling,
                        dancing, spending time with family, and sharing a good
                        glass of wine with friends.

                        Angela Drew is a mother, dancer, author, poet and
                        self-proclaimed linguistic artist who has loved the
                        rhythm of words for as long as she can remember.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Born in Berkeley, CA, she began writing at age eight and
                        has always understood that words have the power to
                        soothe, stir, or solidify connection. Thus, her lifelong
                        love affair with storytelling began.
                        <br />

                        the beauty and majesty of our elders and the richness
                        they bring by simply being a part of our lives.
